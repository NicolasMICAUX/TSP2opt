# TSP2opt
Python library implemented in Rust for the 2opt heuristic to solve the TSP. 


## Requirements

## Use 

## Rust library
To achieve great performance, the computationnaly intensive local search is implemented in rust. 

### Algorithm

The 2-opt local search is implemented in rust, the corresponding rust crates is `tsp2opt/pyext-2opt`. Implementation can be modified directly in the `src/lib.rs` file.


### Tests
Basic tests are implemented for the rust implementation, run `cargo test`.
